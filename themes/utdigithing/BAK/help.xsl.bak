                        This page provides help for searching,  browsing, and submitting to the UT Digital Repository.</p>
                    <p>
                        The  UT Digital Repository captures, distributes and preserves digital research  products. Here you can find articles, working papers, preprints, technical  reports, conference papers and data sets in various digital formats. Content  grows daily as new communities and collections are added to the Repository.</p>
                    <p>
                        The  Repository content is organized around Communities. Within each community there  can be an unlimited number sub-communities and an unlimited number of  collections. Each collection may contain an unlimited number of works.</p>
                    <div align="center">

                    <p><a name="browse" id="browse"></a><strong>BROWSE </strong><a href="#top">top</a> </p>
                    <p><strong>Browse</strong> allows you to go through a  list of works in some specified order:</p>
                    <p><strong>Browse  by Community/Collection</strong> takes you through the communities in alphabetical order and allows you to see  the sub-communities and collections within each community.</p>
                    <p><strong>Browse  by Date Created </strong>allows  you to move through a list of all works in the Repository in chronological  order by publication date (if previously published) or date of creation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Browse  by Author</strong> allows you to move through an alphabetical list of all authors of works in the  Repository.</p>
                    <p><strong>Browse  by Title</strong> allows you to move through an alphabetical list of all titles of works in the  Repository.</p>
                    <p><strong>Browse  by Subject </strong>allows  you to move through an alphabetical list of subjects/tags assigned to works in  the Repository.</p>
                    <p><strong>Browse by Department</strong> allows you to move through  an alphabetical list of academic departments and research units on campus  assigned to works in the Repository.</p>

                    <p><a name="search" id="search"></a><strong>SEARCH</strong> <a href="#top">top</a><br />
                        To  search all of the Repository, use the search box at the top of the navigation  bar on the right (or the search box in the middle of the home page)</p>
                    <p align="center"><img src="/themes/utdigithing/images/help/searchrep.JPG" alt="Search Repository Screenshot" /></p>
                    <p> To  limit your search to a specific community or collection, navigate to that  community or collection and use the search bar on that page.</p>
                    <p align="center"> <img src="/themes/utdigithing/images/help/searchcoll.JPG" alt="Search Collections Screenshot" /></p>
                    <p>The  Repository uses the<strong> Jakarta Lucene </strong>search engine. Here are some search  hints:</p>
                    <p><strong>What  is searched in the general keyword search<br />
                    </strong>The word(s)  you enter in the search box will be searched against the title, author, subject  abstract, series, sponsor and identifier fields of each work's record.</p>
                    <p><strong>What  is not searched - Stop Words<br />
                    </strong>Thesearch  engine ignores certain words that occur frequently in English, but do not add  value to the search. These are:</p>
                    <p align="center">
                        &quot;a&quot;, &quot;and&quot; , &quot;are&quot; ,  &quot;as&quot; , &quot;at&quot; , &quot;be&quot; , &quot;but&quot; ,  &quot;by&quot; , &quot;for&quot; , &quot;if&quot; , &quot;in&quot; ,  &quot;into&quot;, <br />
                        &quot;is&quot; ,&quot;it&quot; ,&quot;no&quot; ,  &quot;not&quot; , &quot;of&quot; , &quot;on&quot; , &quot;or&quot; ,  &quot;such&quot;, &quot;the&quot; , &quot;to&quot; , &quot;was&quot;</p>
                    <p><strong>Truncation<br />
                    </strong>Use an  asterisk (*) after a word stem to get all hits having words starting with that root,  for example: <br />
                        <img src="/themes/utdigithing/images/help/search1.gif" alt="Screenshot: Search" /> will retrieve selects, selector, selectman, selecting. </p>
                    <p><strong>Stemming <br />
                    </strong>The search  engine automatically expands words with common endings to include plurals, past  tenses ...etc.</p>
                    <p><strong>Phrase  Searching</strong><br />
                        To search using multiple words as a phrase, put quotation marks (&quot;) around  the phrase.</p>
                    <p align="center"><img src="/themes/utdigithing/images/help/search8.jpg" alt="Screenshot: Search for Phrase"/></p>
                    <p><strong>Exact  word match</strong><br />
                        Put a plus (+) sign before a word if it MUST appear in the search result. For  instance, in the following search the word &quot;training&quot; is optional,  but the word &quot;dog&quot; must be in the result. </p>
                    <p><img src="/themes/utdigithing/images/help/search2.gif" alt="Screenshot: Search for exact words" /></p>
                    <p><strong>Eliminate  works with unwanted words<br />
                    </strong>Put a minus  (-) sign before a word if it should not appear in the search results.  Alternatively, you can use <strong>NOT</strong>. This can limit your search to eliminate  unwanted hits. For instance, in the search <br />
                        <img src="/themes/utdigithing/images/help/search3.jpg" alt="Screenshot: Search with not appear" /> or  <img src="/themes/utdigithing/images/help/search4.jpg" alt="OR Screenshot: Search with not appear" />
                        you  will get works containing the word &quot;training&quot;, except those that also  contain the word &quot;cat&quot;.</p>
                    <p><strong>Boolean  searching</strong> <br />
                        The  following Boolean operators can be used to combine terms. Note that they must  be CAPITALIZED!</p>
                    <p>
                    <strong>AND</strong> - to limit searches to find  works containing all words or phrases combined with this operator, e.g.<br />
                    <img src="/themes/utdigithing/images/help/search5.jpg" alt="Screenshot: Search with AND" /> will  retrieve all works that contain BOTH the words &quot;cats&quot; and  &quot;dogs&quot;.<br />
                    <strong>OR</strong> - to enlarge searches to  find works containing any of the words or phrases surrounding this operator <br />
                    <img src="/themes/utdigithing/images/help/search6.jpg" alt="Screenshot: Search with OR" /> will  retrieve all works that contain EITHER the words &quot;cats&quot; or  &quot;dogs&quot;.<br />
                    <strong>NOT  - </strong>to exclude  works containing the word following this operator, e.g. <br />
                    <img src="/themes/utdigithing/images/help/search4.jpg" alt="Screenshot: Search with NOT" /> will  retrieve all works that contain the word &quot;training&quot; EXCEPT those also  containing the word &quot;cat&quot;.<br />
                    Parentheses  can be used in the search query to group search terms into sets, and operators  can then be applied to the whole set, e.g.<br />
                    <img src="/themes/utdigithing/images/help/search7.jpg" alt="Screenshot: Search with Parentheses" /></p>
                    <div align="center">
                        <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center" />
                    </div>
                    <p><a name="advanced" id="advanced"></a><strong>ADVANCED SEARCH</strong> <a href="#top">top</a></p>
                    <p>
                        The  advanced search page allows you to specify the fields you wish to search, and  to combine these searches with the Boolean &quot;AND&quot;, &quot;OR&quot; or  &quot;NOT&quot;. <br />
                        You  can restrict your search to a community by clicking on the arrow to the right  of the top box. If you want your search to encompass all of The Repository,  leave that box in the default position.</p>
                    <p><img src="/themes/utdigithing/images/help/advsearch.JPG" alt="Screenshot: Advanced Search" /><br />
                        Then  select the field to search in the left hand column and enter the word or phrase  you are searching in the right hand column. You can select the Boolean operator  to combine searches by clicking on the arrow to the right of the  &quot;AND&quot; box. <br />
                        <strong>Note:  You must use the input boxes in order. If you leave the first one blank your  search will not work. </strong> </p>
                    <div align="center">
                        <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center" />

                        The  Repository content is organized around Communities. Within each community there  can be an unlimited number of sub-communities and an unlimited number of  collections. Each collection may contain an unlimited number of works. This  organization gives The Repository the flexibility to accommodate differing  needs of communities by allowing them to </p>

Collections  can be organized around a topic, or by type of information (such as working  papers or datasets) or by any other sorting method a community finds useful in  organizing its digital works.

                        The submission process is the function that enables users to add a work to the  Repository. The process of submission includes uploading the file(s) comprising  the digital work and filling out information about the work on a form. Each  community sets its own submission policy.<br />
                        Submitting  a work to the Repository is a multi-step process. At any point in the  submission process you can stop and save your work for a later date by clicking  on the “cancel/save” button at the bottom of the page. The data you have  already entered will be stored until you return to the submission, and you will  be reminded on your &quot;My Account&quot; page that you have a submission in  process. If somehow you accidentally exit from the submission process, you can  always resume from your &quot;My Account&quot; page. You can also cancel your  submission at any point. </p>

                        Now  that your submission has been successfully entered into The Repository system,  it will go through the workflow process designated for the collection to which  you are submitting. Some collections require the submission to go through  editing or review steps, while others may immediately accept the submission.  You will receive e-mail notification as soon as your work has become a part of  the collection, or if there is a problem with your submission. If you have  questions about the workflow procedures for a particular collection, please  contact the Repository Curator at <a href="mailto:utdr-collections@utlists.utexas.edu">utdr-collections@utlists.utexas.edu</a>.

The Repository is committed to maintaining the integrity of this  identifier so that you can safely use it to refer to your work when citing it  in publications or other communications.
